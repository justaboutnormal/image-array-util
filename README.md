# image-array-util

Basic image array manipulations written in Clojure.

Inspiration for these tests were taken from a class I took in collage where we built a basic image manipulation application.
I wanted to rewrite some of the more memorable methods I wrote using imperative Java in a declarative manor. This is not an
application, a library, nor full-featured.
